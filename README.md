# linux-controller-config
A GUI tool for remapping controller inputs on Linux for those pesky times your controller doesn't work out of the box.

Using wxWidgets and the linux/joystick API, this provides a nice-to-use interface for remapping controls.

# Planned Features
These aren't here yet but they're next on the list.
- Saving/loading maps in a file (preferably automatically).
- Axis calibration.
